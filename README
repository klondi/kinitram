ABOUT
===============================================================================
kinitram is intended to be a small simple initram which can be used to unlock
luks hard drives (specially remotely) and get access on early boot to fix
issues. It also intends to be embedded on a kernel image so it can be used to
securely control the system integrity using Secure Boot.

So yeah it's kind of a lightweight poor man's KVM.

HISTORY
===============================================================================
This initram was originally developed for use at both the xiscosoft servers and
the Lejklon company project.
The main reason behind it's development was getting a secure way to unlock luks
encrypted root partitions on servers, whilst making tampering with them
(without physical access) hard.

It was originally distributed under an NDA to some Gentoo Hardened users as I
expected Lejklon to start up with the intention of freeing it later when the
company had gotten some clients and allowing them to audit our code would
become important.

Sadly that never happened as we couldn't find an investor willing to invest on
us. Anyways since it is now clear the company will not take off I want to
release this code in the hopes it is useful to anybody else.

LICENSE
===============================================================================
This code is licensed under an Affero GPL v3 license or at your choice a higher
version of that license released by the Free Software Foundation.

If you contribute code to this project you agree to release it under this same
license and agree that you have permission and are legally entitled to do so.
In case you aren't you agree to take full legal liability for that.

INSTRUCTIONS
===============================================================================
The mkinitramfs.sh can generate the dropbear keys in etc/dropbear for you but
if you want to do it manually use these commands:
# dropbearkey -t rsa -f "initramfs/etc/dropbear/dropbear_rsa_host_key" -s 4096
# dropbearkey -t ecdsa -f "initramfs/etc/dropbear/dropbear_ecdsa_host_key" -s 256
# dropbearkey -t ed25519 -f "initramfs/etc/dropbear/dropbear_ed25519_host_key"

Also push your keys in root/.ssh/authorized_keys and
owner/.ssh/authorized_keys
# cat mykey.pub > initramfs/root/.ssh/authorized_keys
# cat mykey.pub > initramfs/owner/.ssh/authorized_keys

Finally you need to create the crypto device to hold the master key for
unlocking other devices, this is done as follows:

Create the loopback device
# dd if=/dev/zero of=initramfs/crypto bs=$[16384 + 16384 + ((((512/8*4000+2048)*3 + 4095) /4096) * 4096) + 512 ] count=1

Choose whether you will use a strong password or a stronger password hash. Replace yourhostnamehere with the system's hostname.
If you plan to use a strong random generated password use fast unlocking:
# cryptsetup luksFormat --cipher aes-xts-plain64 --key-size 512 --sector-size 512 --label crypto --subsystem yourhostnamehere --type luks2 --pbkdf pbkdf2 --hash sha256 --pbkdf-force-iterations 1000 --use-urandom --keyslot-cipher aes-xts-plain64 --keyslot-key-size 512 --align-payload=1 --luks2-metadata-size 16k --luks2-keyslots-size $[(((512/8*4000+2048)*3 + 4095) /4096) * 4]k initramfs/crypto

Otherwise, use argon2 instead, make sure to set the right memory size based on the system's RAM (usually 3/4s of it):
# cryptsetup luksFormat --cipher aes-xts-plain64 --key-size 512 --sector-size 512 --label crypto --subsystem yourhostnamehere --type luks2 --pbkdf argon2id --pbkdf-memory 1232896 --pbkdf-parallel 4 --pbkdf-force-iterations 16 --use-urandom --keyslot-cipher aes-xts-plain64 --keyslot-key-size 512 --align-payload=1 --luks2-metadata-size 16k --luks2-keyslots-size $[(((512/8*4000+2048)*3 + 4095) /4096) * 4]k initramfs/crypto

Next open the file and create the key
# /sbin/cryptsetup luksOpen initramfs/crypto ckey
# dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/mapper/ckey
# sync

Then add the key to all of the HDDs where it is needed:
# /sbin/cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/myroothd /dev/mapper/ckey

As you can suppose you have to replace /dev/myroothd for the device you want to
decrypt (this depends on your system but it may be a swap partition and a
root device or more partitions too). So yeah, this also means you may need to
call the luksAddKey line more than once.

And finally close the key device
# /sbin/cryptsetup close /dev/mapper/ckey

The root account will give you an early shell whilst the owner account is
only allowed to provide the password to mount the main hard drive.

You may want to go over initramfs/init for example the early shell access will
be dropped before letting the main init system take over which may not be what
you want you may be able to prevent that from hapening by for example adding
a sleep clause.

If you want to embed the initram in the kernel use the generated:
my-initramfs.cpio

You'll notice some paths are hardcoded, this code is intended to be deployed at
/usr/src/initram
This may change on the future though.

TPM
===============================================================================
See README.tpm for instructions on how to use the TPM. The idea is that you
creat a new keyslot in initramfs/crypto with a key the TPM can decrypt for you
if the PCRs match your expected values. You will likely need to adjust the
script in bin too if you change the TPM policy.

Root password for physical recovery shell
===============================================================================
See mkrootpass for commands to allow you to set up the password for the
physical recovery shell (opened when something goes wrong during boot).

You'll likely need to adjust the memory size used by argon2.

HACKING
===============================================================================
Contributions are always welcome if they adhere to the license. Before you
contribute something think about keeping it reasonably modular as most users
will not have exactly your use case. BB shell is prefered as the initramfs
shouldn't need compilation.
